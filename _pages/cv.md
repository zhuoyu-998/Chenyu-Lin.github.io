Project experiences
=====
* National-level SRTP:AFM super-resolution imaging study
  * Introduction: In view of the long time and high cost of traditional AFM imaging, the current rapidly developing super-resolution technology is introduced into AFM imaging, and the different characteristics of different methods are used to compare with the super-resolution method based on double cubic interpolation, and propose the super-resolution method of AFM images.
  * Duties included: Conduct of the experiment and Report Writing.
