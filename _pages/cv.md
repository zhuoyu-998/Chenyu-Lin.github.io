Project experiences
=====
* National-level SRTP:AFM super-resolution imaging study(2021.06-2022.06）
  * Introduction: In view of the long time and high cost of traditional AFM imaging, the current rapidly developing super-resolution technology is introduced into AFM imaging, and the different characteristics of different methods are used to compare with the super-resolution method based on double cubic interpolation, and propose the super-resolution method of AFM images.
  * Duties included: Conduct of the experiment and Report Writing.
  * Project achievement:
    * Publication:
     * [1]林泓，**林晨宇**，吴腾，韩国强*，基于SRCNN的AFM超分辨率成像 [J].《机械制造与自动化》，已录用，2022.
     * [2] Guoqiang Han, Teng Wu, Luyao Lv, Huaidong Li, Hong Lin, **Chenyu Lin**, Jian Luo*, Super-Resolution AFM Imaging Based on Enhanced Convolutional Neural 		Network[J].Nano, Accepted, 2022.
* An Aliyun-based voice controlled light switch（2022）
  * Introduction: An electric light switch  controlled by Arduino ESP8266.It has the functions of voice recognition,and the switch is switched on and off by controlling the rotation of the tiller through Xiaoyao.
  * Duties included: Program debugging; editing of [demo video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g84y1w7uU/?vd_source=fe26f92cd0edfefb1b705f22b8722cfe).
  * Project achievement: Be marked as the best curriculum design in “Microcomputer Principle” course
