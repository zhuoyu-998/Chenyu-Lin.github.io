About me
======
During my undergraduate period I received the guidance of Prof. Weilin Luo. He is also generously helping me with my graduation thesis, which addresses the underwater image denoising.

My campus life is colourful and unforgettable. But the most enjoyable part for me must be the experiences in Student Research Training Project, in which I and my teammates worked together on deep learning. In return, we published a paper in a core journal. Taking part in such project really stimulates me to learn things.

Our team has made a voice controlled light switch as a curriculum design. I have done the main program in C, the tracking control system in MicroPython and the editing of this video.
