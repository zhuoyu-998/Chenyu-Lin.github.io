I am a senior in [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/), Fujian, China, who major in Mechanical Design and Their Automation. My research interests focus on Internet of things, computer vision and deep learning. You can click [here](https://zhuoyu-998.github.io/Chenyu-Lin.github.io//cv/) to view my curriculum vitae.

About me
======
During my undergraduate period I received the guidance of Prof. Weilin Luo. He is also generously helping me with my graduation thesis, which addresses the underwater image denoising.

My campus life is colourful and unforgettable. But the most enjoyable part for me must be the experiences in Student Research Training Project, in which I and my teammates worked together on deep learning. In return, we published a paper in a core journal. Taking part in such project really stimulates me to learn things.

Our team has made a voice controlled light switch as a curriculum design. I have done the main debugging in Arduino and the editing of [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g84y1w7uU/?vd_source=fe26f92cd0edfefb1b705f22b8722cfe).

A glance into the future
=====
Now I’m preparing entrance exams for postgraduate, aiming at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I’m looking forward to join the brand new environment and cooperate with new friends!
